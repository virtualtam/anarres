Contributing to Anarres
=======================

Anarres is a personal project, and is open-sourced in the hope others might
find it useful and use it as an example or inspiration for their own automation
projects. This repository might also serve as support material for
blog posts or presentations.

It does not rely on community-maintained Ansible roles published on Galaxy,
as I want to keep roles as simple as possible, and do not plan to generalize
them to environments and/or distributions other than the ones I use on a daily
basis.
