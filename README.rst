Anarres

Automation for your GNU/Linux workstation!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anarres is a collection of `Ansible`_ roles and playbooks, and aims at
automating (as much as possible) the setup of:

- bare metal GNU/Linux workstations;
- virtual GNU/Linux machines, with the help of `VirtualBox`_ and `Vagrant`_.

This project started as a way of tracking all the packages and libraries I
install on my Arch Linux hosts for daily and occasional usage:

- a desktop environment,
- some text editors,
- my `dotfiles <https://github.com/virtualtam/dotfiles>`_,
- a whole bunch of programming languages, interpreters, libraries, and debugging
  symbols,
- network, filesystem and performance utilities,
- multimedia players and editing software,
- etc.

It eventually turned into an experiment to see how much of a desktop setup could
be automated, which proved to be extremely useful to spin development
GNU/Linux virtual machines while working on a Windows workstation.
